# Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

This was my final project for MATH 399 (Numerical Approach to Partial Differential Equations).

## Feature
 - Simulates given valid ave function to estimate the time-evolution of wave function
 - Uses the fourier tranformation to represent the wavefunction in momentum space.
